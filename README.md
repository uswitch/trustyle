## Development
All commands can be run from individual packages, but it is not
necessary to do so.

- Run `npm install` at the project root to install the dev
  dependencies.
- Run `npx lerna bootstrap` to link package dependencies to each
  other.

To run storybook locally `npm start`.

To run each packageâ€™s build script, run `npx lerna run build`. You
don't usually have to do this as you don't need it for local
development and the publish script runs it for you on publish.

To add a new element, copy the template to the src/elements directory,
update the package.json with the name and add your source code.

## Publishing
To preview which packages have changed, you can run `npx lerna
changed` without publishing.

Once happy with the code changes, run `npx lerna version` and bump the
versions accordingly.

Lerna will generate a publish commit. Push that commit to your remote
branch and once it gets merged to master, CI will publish the new
versions to `npm`.

# Principles

## Error handling

As a principle, components should be _smart_ about handling
errors. Errors should fall under _two_ categories

- **Fatal** - The component does not have enough information to render
  a _functional_ representation of itself 
  
  _e.g._ Missing required props
  
- **Non Fatal** - The component can render a _functional_ version, but is
  degraded visually
  
  _e.g._ A broken icon/image
  
As an example, an `IconButton` should throw a _non fatal_ error if the
`icon` does not exist and render without an icon. It should throw a
_fatal_ error if given an `onClick` that is not a function.
  
All of these errors should be propagated up to be capture by tools
like **Sentry**. But we should only `throw` when the error is _fatal_.

_Fatal_ errors should be documented with the component and handled by
the consuming project.

## TODO:
- Make grid columns automatically take space. so 3 columns would
  automatically render 1/3 on each column, each device by default.
- Make grid s={1/2} auto populate the rest of the sizes. so if you do
  s={1/2} and leave m and l blank, m and l should also be 1/2
- Generate column sizes based on number of columns and gutter widths.
